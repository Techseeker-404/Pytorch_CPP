#### This are the initial steps of a project to predict Brain tumour on some specific MRI images .
##### using C++ ,OpenCV2 and Libtorch (ie,Pytorch C++)

#### sample code of loading the image data using OpenCV and converting it to torch tensors are showcased on sample.cpp file and build using cmake .
##### Used std_C++14 and cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/installation or directory path of/libtorch ..for making the executable file. for more details its better to check on the Libtorch , OpenCV2 and cmake documentations.
